This is a Batch script that checks your internet connection!

I'm pretty sure there's other ways to do the same thing but here's my own workaround to quickly and natively check if the packets are going anywhere and how fast do they go to ensure i have no problems (but in most of the cases i actually do)
There might be the 3.0 update and i'm willing to improve my script

1.0 : 2022.10.23
2.0 : 2023.09.02
3.0 : ?
